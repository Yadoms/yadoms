# This is a template of Python 3.x rule.
# This aims is to demonstrate usage of main functions.
# Full documentation is available by the button below code window.
#
# Yadoms runs your rule by calling the yMain method.
# Yadoms pass its context (the Yadoms script API instance) by the yApi parameter.
# This parameter is used in the rule to call Yadoms methods.
#
# This sample is a simple thermostat, reading a temperature to drive a heating.
# Heating is ON when temperature is lower than a setPoint, and OFF if greater.

# Import some helper functions (see help)
import scriptUtilities

# The temperature setPoint.
setPoint = 21.5

   # Usually, we first get all required keyword IDs. The method getKeywordId
   # takes the device name and keyword name as arguments (see Keyword page on the dashboard).
   # Replace devices and keywords by your real sensor/actuator, or instantiate a fakePlugin.

# This is a template of Python 2.7.x rule.
# This aims is to demonstrate usage of main functions.
# Full documentation is available by the button below code window.

# Yadoms runs your rule by calling the yMain method.
# Yadoms pass its context (the Yadoms script API instance) by the yApi parameter.
# This parameter is used in the rule to call Yadoms methods.

# This sample is a simple thermostat, reading a temperature to drive a heating.
# Heating is ON when temperature is lower thant setPoint, and OFF if greater.

# The temperature setPoint.

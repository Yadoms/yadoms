   //   FUNCTION: CApplicationService::OnStart(DWORD, LPWSTR *)
   //
   //   PURPOSE: The function is executed when a Start command is sent to the 
   //   service by the SCM or when the operating system starts (for a service 
   //   that starts automatically). It specifies actions to take when the 
   //   service starts. In this code sample, OnStart logs a service-start 
   //   message to the Application log, and queues the main service function for 
   //   execution in a thread pool worker thread.
   //
   //   PARAMETERS:
   //   * dwArgc   - number of command line arguments
   //   * lpszArgv - array of command line arguments
   //
   //   NOTE: A service application is designed to be long running. Therefore, 
   //   it usually polls or monitors something in the system. The monitoring is 
   //   set up in the OnStart method. However, OnStart does not actually do the 
   //   monitoring. The OnStart method must return to the operating system after 
   //   the service's operation has begun. It must not loop forever or block. To 
   //   set up a simple monitoring mechanism, one general solution is to create 
   //   a timer in OnStart. The timer would then raise events in your code 
   //   periodically, at which time your service could do its monitoring. The 
   //   other solution is to spawn a new thread to perform the main service 
   //   functions, which is demonstrated in this code sample.

   //   FUNCTION: CApplicationService::OnStop(void)
   //
   //   PURPOSE: The function is executed when a Stop command is sent to the 
   //   service by SCM. It specifies actions to take when a service stops 
   //   running. In this code sample, OnStop logs a service-stop message to the 
   //   Application log, and waits for the finish of the main service function.

   //   COMMENTS:
   //   Be sure to periodically call ReportServiceStatus() with 
   //   SERVICE_STOP_PENDING if the procedure is going to take long time.

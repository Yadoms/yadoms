/// This interface manages a buffer, which is filled by a communication port.

/// an event handler when a message is considered as valid.
/// As messages can be received in many times, the implementation
/// have to reagregate received data and notify event handler
/// when a full message is received.
/// As evaluation of a valid message is dependant of the protocol used,
/// you probably have to write your implementation.
